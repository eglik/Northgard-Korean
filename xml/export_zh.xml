				<5>
					<text>Dozens of armed men suddenly poured into the Hall and put an abrupt end to our ambitions... and to our lives.</text>

				<6>
					<text>They were mercenaries led by a man named Hagen, from the Clan of the Raven.</text>
				</6>
				<7>
					<text>In a matter of minutes, we were all slaughtered like sheep.</text>
				</7>
				<8>
					<text>All… but me. Barely conscious and vastly outnumbered, I had no way to fight back, so I feigned death.</text>
				</8>
				<9>
					<text>I seethed as he stole the map of Northgard and ripped the Regal Horn from my father's throne, a family heirloom and the very symbol of our royalty.</text>

					<text>Good day, my lords. I see we have all come to the same conclusion: this region should be the commercial nerve center for the victors.</text>
				</2>
				<3 id="start4" who="Brand">
					<text>Greetings. You must be Liv of the Raven Clan, lieutenant to that scum Hagen. I would rather be your ally than your enemy, but the Norns seem to disagree.</text>
				</3>
				<4 id="start5" who="Rig">
					<text>Do not expect mercy from me, Raven. Soon enough, all goods entering Northgard will have to go through us.</text>
				</4>
				<5 id="start6" who="Liv">
					<text>Indeed, there is only room for one trade tycoon. And I'm afraid I cannot let you put a spoke in my wheel. Still, I wish you good luck.</text>
				</5>
				<6 id="start7" who="Halvard">
					<text>Refreshing to see that battles can still be fought without childish chest-thumping. We too bid you good fortune, for you will need it!</text>
				</6>
				<7 id="start8" who="Rig">
					<text>We had better get started. The key to victory is to build a longship dock and a lighthouse, then make use of great trade routes.</text>
				</7>
				<8 id="upgrade1NoStoneGoat" who="Halvard">
					<text>Apologies, young lord, but should we not worry about gathering stone? Stone is instrumental in upgrading buildings.</text>
				</8>
				<9 id="upgrade1NoStoneStag" who="Brand">
					<text>My lord, I just got word that we have no stone in our reserves. We should build a mine and gather some, as is it vital for building upgrades.</text>
				</9>
				<10 id="upgrade2" who="Rig">
					<text>I admit it had slipped my mind. Yes, we should find a deposit and exploit it as soon as possible. Then upgrade our buildings, of course.</text>
				</10>
				<11 id="upgrade1Stone" who="Rig">
					<text>Well, winter is behind us, and we have some stone in store... Now we should try to upgrade as many buildings as possible.</text>
				</11>
				<12 id="upgrade3" who="DefaultBannerman">
					<text>Good thinking. Upgrading is more than just a luxury–it is key to victory. It will allow us to affect more workers and make our activities more efficient.</text>
				</12>
				<13 id="upgrade4" who="DefaultBannerman">
					<text>We probably won't be able to upgrade all our structures, though. We should carefully determine which are most important.</text>
				</13>
				<14 id="upgrade5" who="Rig">
					<text>And we should remember to keep mining iron, as well. Our workers could use better tools!</text>
				</14>
				<15 id="giant1" who="Brand">
					<text>Giants, how wonderful! Northgard is just full of surprises. Rather intimidating ones at that.</text>
				</15>
				<16 id="giant2" who="Halvard">
					<text>The Jötnar are said to be formidable opponents. They are peaceful but will take any intrusion as an aggressive action. I strongly advise against antagonizing them.</text>
				</16>
				<17 id="giant3" who="Rig">
					<text>If they agree to trade with us, we could build a mutually beneficial relationship. It's worth trying. We should establish a route from a trading post.</text>
				</17>
				<18 id="end1" who="Rig">
					<text>Our trade supremacy over the region is now established. Any resource that goes through this estuary will have to go through us.</text>

					<text>Congratulations, my lords. I have been bested, fair and square.</text>
				</19>
				<20 id="end3" who="Liv">
					<text>I suspect my master will not take this kindly, however. So, do enjoy this hegemony of yours while it lasts.</text>
				</20>
				<21 id="end4" who="Liv">
					<text>Well, this region has outlived its usefulness to me. I bid you farewell.</text>
				</21>
				<22 id="end5" who="Liv">
					<text>I am less than eager to hear Hagen's reaction to this. No doubt I am in for an earful...</text>
				</22>
				<23 id="end6" who="Halvard">
					<text>What an uncanny reaction. She had fought with fierceness and resolve, and yet her praise seemed sincere.</text>
				</23>
				<24 id="end7" who="Rig">
					<text>Brand, Halvard, I've just heard from Egil. He has tracked Hagen down to a region nearby, and so I shall join him now. I would ask you to fortify what we've built here.</text>
				</24>
				<25 id="end8" who="Brand">
					<text>I am glad your revenge is at last within your reach. Be safe, my lord. We will join you as soon as we can.</text>
				</25>
				<26 id="end9" who="Halvard">
					<text>Do keep in mind: all our future operations can connect to this region by establishing a trade route from a trading post.</text>
				</26>
				<27 id="defeat1" who="Liv">
					<text>It is done. Your control of the region is negligible. Oh, I will trade with you, but do not expect friendly prices!</text>
				</27>
				<28 id="defeat2" who="Brand">
					<text>'Tis a disaster, my lord! There is no way we can conquer Northgard after losing such a strategically vital chokepoint!</text>

				<29 id="defeat3" who="Halvard">
					<text>All that effort... for naught!</text>
				</29>
				<30 id="ravenBuiltLighthouse1" who="DefaultBannerman">
					<text>I am loath to report this, but Liv has finished building her lighthouse. She is bound to launch major expeditions soon!</text>
				</30>
				<31 id="ravenBuiltLighthouse2" who="Rig">
					<text>This means building a lighthouse of our own should be our top priority. We cannot afford to fall behind.</text>
				</31>
				<32 id="ravenAheadStage1" who="DefaultBannerman">
					<text>Reports show that Liv has a good headstart. We should work twice as hard to keep from falling behind.</text>
				</32>
				<33 id="ravenAheadStage2" who="DefaultBannerman">
					<text>Liv has taken the lead. We need to hurry and catch up with her!</text>
				</33>
				<34 id="ravenWinning1Stag" who="Brand">
					<text>Curses! Liv is winning this war! Even if we put all our resources into the most prominent routes, we could not catch up with her.</text>
				</34>
				<35 id="ravenWinning1Goat" who="Halvard">
					<text>Young lord, I abhor the thought, but I fear we are fighting a losing battle. According to my calculations, Liv is so far ahead we cannot possibly catch up with her.</text>
				</35>
				<36 id="ravenWinning2" who="Rig">
					<text>I have reached the same conclusion. But there is still one way we can win this.</text>
				</36>
				<37 id="ravenWinning3Stag" who="Brand">
					<text>Are you suggesting we harry her with our armed forces?</text>
				</37>
				<38 id="ravenWinning3Goat" who="Halvard">
					<text>Surely you're not considering this...</text>
				</38>
				<39 id="ravenWinning4" who="Rig">
					<text>I am. Attacking Liv now would force her to divert resources to defense. I do not suggest we try to defeat her militarily–we need only hinder her progress long enough to close the gap.</text>
				</39>
				<40 id="ravenWinning5Stag" who="Brand">
					<text>She will most likely retaliate, but this is preferable to losing the region right away, which we are bound to do at this rate. Well thought out, my lord.</text>
				</40>
				<41 id="ravenWinning5Goat" who="Halvard">
					<text>This may well be the only viable strategy we have left. Nevertheless, we should expect a swift retaliation.</text>
				</41>
				<42 id="ravenAttacked1" who="Liv">
					<text>Using force, are you? Perhaps I expected too much finesse from brutes like you. Boys will be boys, I suppose.</text>
				</42>
				<43 id="ravenAttacked2" who="Liv">
					<text>Well, you shall have to negotiate with my mercenaries.</text>
				</43>
				<44 id="endDestroyRaven1" who="Rig">

				</44>
				<45 id="endDestroyRaven2" who="Liv">
					<text>I cannot say I expected this outcome. 'Twas all fun and games, yet I fear someone may lose an eye. That's it, then. I humbly surrender.</text>
				</45>
				<46 id="endDestroyRaven3Goat" who="Halvard">
					<text>This is most awkward. To be honest, I didn't condone this military assault, but Lord Rig insisted on putting the war back in "trade war."</text>
				</46>
				<47 id="endDestroyRaven3Stag" who="Brand">
					<text>I do not entirely subscribe to this definition of victory, but Lord Rig appears to believe that a trade war is still a war.</text>

					<text>With a serene face betraying no inner turmoil, Svarn, the rebel Boar leader, detailed Hvedrung's plan, although I could feel something boiling deep within him.</text>
				</0>
				<1>
					<text>The tyrant intended to destroy Bifrost, the legendary bridge to Asgard, for reasons unknown. But this would bring about Ragnarök, the end of the gods... and of our time. Svarn's rebellion existed solely to prevent this.</text>

				<2>
					<text>Bifrost lay hidden, somewhere deep within Northgard. Svarn hoped to learn more by deciphering the gigantic Runestone of Asgard, an ancient frieze said to have been engraved by Odin himself.</text>

					<text>Bergelmir divided the land in two–the land you now call Jötunnheim. The sword was never intended as a symbol of division, but rather of sharing: the land... pain... joys. He wanted his sons to live AND work together.</text>

					<text>Slaying such a fiend would be worthy of a skald's song. It will not go down easily, though, so make sure you send enough warriors.</text>

				<55 id="wyv_unknown_small_wyvern2Goat" who="Halvard">
					<text>'Tis the most terrifying thing I have seen in my days. And believe me, young lord, I have witnessed a great deal. Many men and women will likely die fighting this beast, if you so command it.</text>

					<text>Wyverns are... mighty foes. We usually respect them and leave them be, although killing it would surely impress the she-bear.</text>

					<text>It certainly won't go down without a fight. Warriors, brace yourselves!</text>

					<text>Another wyvern! Hmm, according to legend, the azure ones are somewhat less dangerous than what we encountered earlier. It should be easier to defeat.</text>

				<61 id="wyv_known_small_wyvern2Stag" who="Brand">
					<text>Indeed. We would lose fewer men and women than against the crimson type.</text>
				</61>
				<62 id="wyv_known_small_wyvern2Goat" who="Halvard">

				</62>
				<63 id="wyv_known_small_wyvern2Wolf" who="Egil">
					<text>Yeah, but it's less fun, too. The crimson bugger was more... bitey.</text>
				</63>
				<64 id="wyv_known_small_wyvern2Raven" who="Liv">
					<text>It still looks pretty nasty. But if we REALLY must slay things to show off, it might be a better choice than the crimson, nightmare-fueling one.</text>

				<65 id="wyv_known_small_wyvern2Boar" who="Svarn">
					<text>It is indeed less dangerous than the crimson variety... but make no mistake, it is still a very tough creature.</text>

					<text>It looks fearsome, indeed. We certainly should not expect this battle to be easily won, if winnable at all.</text>
				</67>
				<68 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern2Goat" who="Halvard">
					<text>Attacking such a beast would be madness, young lord! I beg you not to give in to hubris. My people are tough survivors, but ordering them to face this monster would be tantamount to murder.</text>
				</68>
				<69 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern2Wolf" who="Egil">
					<text>Whoa, I might actually be experiencing fear for the first time ever. Nah, just kidding. I'm not sure my axes can even put a dent in its scales, though. Only one way to find out!</text>
				</69>
				<70 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern2Raven" who="Liv">
					<text>Well, this is absurd. Throwing warriors at this creature would be a needless waste of human life. On the other hand–and I can hardly believe I'm considering it–slaying it would give us a definite edge in the contest...</text>
				</70>
				<71 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern2Boar" who="Svarn">
					<text>I have seen wyverns, but never the crimson kind. I foresee many lives being wiped out if you decide to fight it, although... it would most certainly be the stuff of legends.</text>
				</71>
				<72 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern3Stag" who="Rig">
					<text>Agreed. At any rate, it would require more than a few warriors to bring it down. I will have to carefully consider this.</text>

					<text>You may just be right, Halvard. Yet somehow I feel we are up to the task... if we prepare carefully beforehand, that is.</text>
				</73>
				<74 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern3Wolf" who="Rig">
					<text>I know your warriors are ready to die just for a chance to fight such a unique beast. We will probably have to send in quite a few of them, though.</text>
				</74>
				<75 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern3Raven" who="Rig">
					<text>'Tis quite a gamble, indeed. We stand to lose many in the fight, but should we succeed... At any rate, we shall have to plan ahead carefully.</text>

				<76 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern3Boar" who="Rig">
					<text>Many lives would be lost, 'tis true. On the other hand, if Borgild's people manage to bring it down, we might be done for. I will have to think it over.</text>

				<78 id="wyv_known_big_wyvern2Stag" who="Brand">
					<text>It does look mightier. We should not take this beast lightly. In all likelihood, we shall have to draw even more warriors into the fight.</text>

					<text>Yeah, it looks bigger and badder. I wonder if my axes can even make a dent in its scales. Let's find out!</text>
				</80>
				<81 id="wyv_known_big_wyvern2Raven" who="Liv">
					<text>From a purely rational point of view, it represents even more risk, but for a similar reward. Of course, not killing it would be a missed opportunity entirely. But is it worth the extra danger?</text>
				</81>

					<text>I say we slay 'em and take their land! That oughta show Borgild what we're made of! Sure, we could trade food with them and make them our allies... but that'd be boring.</text>
				</86>
				<87 id="giant2Raven" who="Liv">
					<text>There are two ways we could gain fame from them: either defeat them and claim their land, or trade food with them until we've befriended them. Both are economically viable options. Decisions, decisions...</text>

					<text>We can either... collaborate with them through trade or... eradicate them and claim their land. Jotnär are powerful allies, but it will be costly. On the other hand, they are mighty foes...</text>

					<text>Just as I was about to end his miserable life, Hvedrung smiled peacefully, betraying no hint of regret or bitterness.</text>

					<text>"You are victorious, High King," he said, "but you still arrived too late. Bifrost may still stand, yet the World Tree has been shaken to its roots. You think you prevented Ragnarök; I say we are in the midst of it."</text>
				</2>
				<3>
					<text>He went on: "My work here is done; the men may not yet be free from Odin's yoke, but they now know that defiance is an option. This is the dawn of a new era. Do what you will with me, spare me or kill me; it matters not."</text>
				</3>
				<4>
					<text>Why those words pierced my soul, I shall never know. I suddenly lost all will to kill him, realizing how futile it would be. It would never bring my father back, and he was right; Ragnarök WAS happening.</text>

					<text>Or rather... it IS happening. This is a new era indeed. Our story is not over; it is only beginning. Northgard needs to heal, and we will be here to tend to its wounds.</text>

		<BannerStag>
			<desc>Proud and noble at heart, the bannerman of the Stag Clan is a loyal man who lives and fights with honor. Nothing matters more to him than his people's wellbeing. He is faithful to you, as his father was to yours, and is willing to help you exact your revenge... and conquer Northgard!</desc>
		</BannerStag>
		<BannerGoat>
			<desc>The elderly bannerman of the Goat Clan is a wise and kind-hearted man focused on the survival of his people. He abhors senseless violence, but still packs quite a punch when provoked. He and the Heidrun Clan pledged allegiance to you after you saved them from ravenous wolves.</desc>
		</BannerGoat>
		<BannerWolf>
			<desc>A ruthless and impetuous young berserker, the bannerman of the Wolf Clan is mostly in it for the mayhem. Brand had little trouble rallying him to your cause: a quest for vengeance and the prospect of glorious battle were enough to get him excited.</desc>
		</BannerWolf>
		<BannerRaven>
			<desc>Ambitious and pragmatic, the cunning bannermaiden of the Raven Clan likes to control every parameter of a situation and hates wasting time or Kröwns on futile pursuits. Seeing that the tide was turning, she didn't hesitate to kill Hagen, her mentor, to prove her loyalty to you.</desc>
		</BannerRaven>
		<BannerBoar>
			<desc>The taciturn spiritual leader of the Boar Clan rebels is a sage and warrior who lives a simple life, close to nature and in accordance with the Old Ways. His uprising against Hvedrung was close to being crushed when you intervened. He is more than willing to help you, since you have a common nemesis.</desc>
		</BannerBoar>
		<BannerBear>
			<desc>Brave and arrogant, the bannermaiden of the Bear Clan is a tough woman who bows to no one and shows little mercy for the weakhearted. She refused to recognize you as the rightful king since you lost the Regal Horn, and so she challenged you to a contest, from which you emerged victorious. She had no choice but to grudgingly pledge her allegiance.</desc>
